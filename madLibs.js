const story =  ` One bright morning, I set sail on a pirate ship named The Black Pearl. 
The endless sea stretched endlessly before us. Just then, we spotted a mysterious chest floating in 
the water. 'Could it be treasure?' the captain exclaimed. We hauled it aboard and opened it. 
Did you know 5 Ã— 5 equals 25? Incredible, right? ` ;
